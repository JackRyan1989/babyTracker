Yeah, so my wife and I watched that 'Babies' documentary on Netflix, and the one episode that stood out was the one about sleep patterns.

And of course it did. I like to sleep, but circadian rhythms are super cool. 

I'm interested in using this app for several reasons:

1. So we can check whether we're doing an equal amount of work.
2. So we can plan our days around when he typically sleeps.
3. I want to see how long it takes for him to develop a regular sleep pattern.

Ultimately, when the data is collected, I want to perform some simple analyses using Python to check out when he entrained to a circadian rhythm. 

So yeah, we'll see where this goes.
